//Tas2. Implement a class called Employee. An employee has a name (a string) 
//and a salary (double). Write a default constructor, a constructor with two 
//parameters (name and salary), a method raiseSalary(double byPercent) that raises the employeeâ€™s
//salary by a certain percentage and methods to return the name and salary. Write a client/driver 
//program to test the Employee class. In the client program, create an Employee object called Stev
//Hacker with a salary of $65,000 and give him a raise of 25%, display the object by invoking its toString()
//cmethod before and after the raise. Draw a UML class diagram.
